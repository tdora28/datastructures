# Data Structure Apps

## Overview

This repository hosts a project developed as an assignment for Business College Helsinki. It features three interactive applications designed to demonstrate the workings of various data structures and algorithms.

## Applications Included

1. Palindrome Checker: An application that allows users to enter any text and checks if it is a palindrome (a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward).
1. Bubble Sort Tester: This application applies the bubble sort algorithm. The user can input several numbers, and the program will sort them into ascending order.
1. Stack Operation Simulator: A tool that simulates the operations of a stack (Last In, First Out - LIFO). Users can push items (plates) onto the stack, and pop items off, observing how the stack behaves in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- Vite: A modern, faster frontend build tool.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
